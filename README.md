# 7zip-batch-zip

This tool will find all the folders in it's launch location and for each one, will create an archive named after that folder with it's contents placed at the root of the archive.

## Requirements

7Zip is the only dependency, but it must be the 64 bit version and located here `c:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe` in order for the tool to run. If your 7zip is in another location, you'll need to find this path in the batch file and tweak it to reflect your own.
